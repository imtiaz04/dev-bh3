Git and GitHub both are Version control systems
THese are 2 types 1.CVCS- Centralised version control system
                  2.DVCS-Distributed version control system
CVCS:It is not locally available ,means we've always need to connected to a network to perform any action
since everything is centrlized ,if servergets failed you loose entaire data.

DVCS:In DVCS every contributor has local copy of amain repository.ex:everyone maintains local repository of their own ,which 
contains all the fils & metadata present in the main repository

Basic commands:

set global username & email for git (Locally)
git config --global user.name "<user name>"
  git config --global user.email "< your email>"
  
  git init :inittialize empty repository
  clone an existing Git repository
  -->git clone <repository_url>
